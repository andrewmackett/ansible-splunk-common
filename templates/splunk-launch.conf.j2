# By default, Splunk stores its indexes under SPLUNK_HOME in the
# var/lib/splunk subdirectory.  This can be overridden
# here:

# SPLUNK_DB=/home/build/build-home/splunk-home/var/lib/splunk
# Splunkd daemon name

# Splunkweb daemon name
SPLUNK_WEB_NAME={{ splunk_web_name }}

# If SPLUNK_OS_USER is set, then Splunk service will only start
# if the 'splunk [re]start [splunkd]' command is invoked by a user who
# is, or can effectively become via setuid(2), $SPLUNK_OS_USER.
# (This setting can be specified as username or as UID.)
